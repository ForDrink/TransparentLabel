TransparentLabel
================

TransparentLabel allows you to create a label that is "cut out"  Instead of drawing the text, the 
label will draw the background and leave the text of the label transparent.  To use just create a
UILabel in Interface builder, set the background color to clear and the foreground/text color to
the color you want the label filled with.
